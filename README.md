**This is just a Proof of Concept at this time. Use at your own risk**

#### Front-end Build System (Babel, Gulp)
Automate your web development process with ease! When changes are made to your code, *MiZ* automatically compiles SASS, minifies images, bundles & uglifies JavaScript -- all in seconds!

## Features
* Multiple projects with a single set of build tasks, compilers, classes, and gulp file.
* Run *Beta*, *Staging*, or *Production* build environments:
* A **configuration file** to change environment variables, build source and destinations, and other build options.
* **SASS** w/ **autoprefixer**, and other helpful plugins.
* **JavaScript bundling and uglify**.
* **Image **minify** and **PNGQuant** to make your images optimized on-the-fly.
* **Favicons generator**.
* Watches all asset folders and automatically copies those files to their corresponding destination folders.
* Includes **Bourbon and Neat** -- http://bourbon.io/
* Scaffold pages and components for rapid development.
* Compile **Jade/Pug** templates.
* Written in ES2015.
 
## Requirements
**NodeJS 6.3 or higher is recommended** for **MiZ** to operate.

## Future Releases
 * A master project that has all of the boilerplate items necessary to get you coding quickly.
 * A CI/CD generator to export to various platforms.
